Programming assignement

the exercices are as follows : 
1. Write a function to find the angle between the minute and hour hand in an analog clock. (Python and C++)

2. What is a virtual function in C++ and how does the compiler handle them?

3. write a command-line program to evaluate a set of equations. (must be C++) (Python and bash are optional plus)
    Like:
    a=b+4
    b=c+d
    d=4
    c=3+2
